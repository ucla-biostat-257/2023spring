    "\n",
    "* Tue/Thu 1pm-2:50pm @ CHS 41-268A   \n",
    "* Instructor: Dr. Hua Zhou  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistics, the science of *data analysis*, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century. \n",
    "\n",
    "* People (scientists, goverment, health professionals, companies) collect data in order to answer certain questions. Statisticians's job is to help them extract knowledge and insights from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If existing software tools readily solve the problem, all the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Often statisticians need to implement their own methods, test new algorithms, or tailor classical methods to new types of data (big, streaming). \n",
    "\n",
    "* This entails at least two essential skills: **programming** and fundamental knowledge of **algorithms**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this course about?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a course on statistical packages. It does not answer questions such as _How to fit a linear mixed model in R,  Julia, SAS, SPSS, or Stata?_\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a pure programming course, although programming is important and we do homework in Julia.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a course on data science. [BIOSTAT 203B (Introduction to Data Science)](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2023winter/schedule/schedule.html) in winter quarter focuses on some software tools for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course focuses on **algorithms**, mostly those in **numerical linear algebra** and **numerical optimization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be highly appreciative of this quote by [James Gentle](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Computational_Statistics/mQ5KAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=inauthor:%22James+E.+Gentle%22)\n",
    "\n",
    "    > The form of a mathematical expression and the way the expression should be evaluated in actual practice may be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}$, $\\operatorname{tr} (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})$, $\\operatorname{diag} (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})$, multivariate normal density, ...  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Become **memory-conscious**. You care about looping order. You do benchmarking on hot functions fanatically to make sure it's not allocating.    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No inversion mentality**. Whenever you see a matrix inverse in mathematical expression, your brain reacts with *matrix decomposition*, *iterative solvers*, etc. For R users, that means you almost never use the `solve(M)` function to obtain inverse of a matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, $\\mathbf{y}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$, Newton-Raphson algorithm, ...   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Master some basic strategies to solve **big data** problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: how Google solve the PageRank problem with $10^{9}$ webpages, linear regression with $10^7$ observations, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. No afraid of **optimizations** and treat it as a technology. Be able to recognize some major optimization classes and choose the best solver(s) correspondingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Be immune to the language fight. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Course logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course webpage: <https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Syllabus](https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring/syllabus/syllabus.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks will be posted/updated before each lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to get started\n",
    "\n",
    "All course materials are in GitHub repo <https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257/2023spring>. Lecture notes are Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) and Quarto Markdown (`.qmd` files) under the `slides` folder. It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Jupyter Notebook in Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick and easy way to run the Jupyter Notebooks is Binder, a free service that allows us to run Jupyter Notebooks in cloud. Simply follow the Binder link at the [schedule](https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring/schedule/schedule.html) page. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the JupyterLab interface, replace the `tree` by `lab` in the URL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Jupyter Notebook locally on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install Julia v1.8.x from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>. On Mac, use Bash command   \n",
    "```bash  \n",
    "sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.8.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia\n",
    "```\n",
    "to create a symbolic link so `julia` command is available anywhere in the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install `IJulia` package. Open Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the package mode, then type\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "add IJulia\n",
    "build IJulia\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Git clone the course material.   \n",

    "git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257/2023spring.git biostat-257-2023spring\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can change `biostat-257-2023spring` to any other directory name you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. On terminal, enter the folder for the ipynb file you want to run, e.g. `biostat-257-2023spring/slides/01-intro/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Open Julia REPL, type  \n",
    "```julia  \n",
    "using IJulia\n",

    "You can change `biostat-257-2023spring` to any other directory name you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Double click the file `2023spring.Rproj` to open the project in RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Navigate to the `slies` folder and run/render `qmd` files as you want.\n",

    "Several unwise choices of algorithms waste lots of flops. The memeory allocations, caused by intermediate results, also slow down the program because of the need for garbage collection.

R code is much slower than Julia possibly because of the outdated BLAS/LAPACK library being used. "
