    "## Basic information\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tue/Thu 1pm-2:50pm @ CHS 41-268A   \n",
    "* Instructor: Dr. Hua Zhou  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statistics, the science of *data analysis*, is the applied mathematics in the 21st century. \n",
    "\n",
    "* People (scientists, goverment, health professionals, companies) collect data in order to answer certain questions. Statisticians's job is to help them extract knowledge and insights from data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If existing software tools readily solve the problem, all the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Often statisticians need to implement their own methods, test new algorithms, or tailor classical methods to new types of data (big, streaming). \n",
    "\n",
    "* This entails at least two essential skills: **programming** and fundamental knowledge of **algorithms**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is this course about?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a course on statistical packages. It does not answer questions such as _How to fit a linear mixed model in R,  Julia, SAS, SPSS, or Stata?_\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a pure programming course, although programming is important and we do homework in Julia.  \n",
    "BIOSTAT 203A (Data Management) in fall quarter focuses on programming in R and SAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Not** a course on data science. [BIOSTAT 203B (Introduction to Data Science)](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2023winter/schedule/schedule.html) in winter quarter focuses on some software tools for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This course focuses on **algorithms**, mostly those in **numerical linear algebra** and **numerical optimization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be highly appreciative of this quote by [James Gentle](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Computational_Statistics/mQ5KAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=inauthor:%22James+E.+Gentle%22)\n",
    "> The form of a mathematical expression and the way the expression should be evaluated in actual practice may be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}$, $\\operatorname{tr} (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})$, $\\operatorname{diag}(\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B})$, multivariate normal density,...  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Become **memory-conscious**. You care about looping order. You do benchmarking on hot functions fanatically to make sure it's not allocating.    \n",
    "<img src=\"./memory.jpg\" align=\"center\" width=\"150\"/>   \n",
    "\n",
    "    [Image source](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/memory-loss-alzheimers-disease-age-of-8-university-college-london-a9178631.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No inversion mentality**. Whenever you see a matrix inverse in mathematical expression, your brain reacts with *matrix decomposition*, *iterative solvers*, etc. For R users, that means you almost never use the `solve(M)` function to obtain inverse of a matrix $\\boldsymbol{M}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: $(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, $\\mathbf{y}^T \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}$, Newton-Raphson algorithm, ...   \n",
    "<img src=\"./yoga_inversion.jpg\" align=\"center\" width=\"250\"/>   \n",
    "\n",
    "    [Image source](https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/inversion-inquiry)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Know some basic strategies to solve **big data** problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples: how Google solve the PageRank problem with $10^{9}$ webpages, linear regression with $10^7$ observations, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. No afraid of **optimizations** and treat it as a technology. Be able to recognize some major optimization classes and choose the best solver(s) correspondingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Be immune to the language fight. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Course logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course webpage: <https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring>.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Syllabus](https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring/syllabus/syllabus.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check the [Schedule](https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring/schedule/schedule.html) page frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Jupyter notebooks will be posted/updated before each lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to get started\n",
    "\n",
    "All course materials are in GitHub repo <https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257/2023spring>. Lecture notes are Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) under the `slides` folder. It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Jupyter Notebook in Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick and easy way to run the Jupyter Notebooks is Binder, a free service that allows us to run Jupyter Notebooks in cloud. Simply follow the Binder link at <https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2023spring/schedule/schedule.html>. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the JupyterLab interface, replace the `tree` by `lab` in the URL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Run Jupyter Notebook locally on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install Julia v1.8.x from <https://julialang.org/downloads/>. On Mac, use Bash command   \n",
    "```bash  \n",
    "sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia\n",
    "```\n",
    "to create a symbolic link so `julia` command is available anywhere in the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Git clone the course material.   \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ucla-biostat-257/2023spring.git biostat-257-2023spring\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can change `biostat-257-2023spring` to any other directory name you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enter the folder `biostat-257-2022spring` on Terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open Julia within that folder, type `]` to enter the package mode, then type  \n",
    "```julia  \n",
    "activate .\n",
    "instantiate\n",
    "```\n",
    "to install necessary packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. In Julia REPL, type  \n",
    "```julia  \n",
    "using IJulia\n",
    "jupyterlab(dir = pwd())\n",
    "```\n",
    "to open the JupyterLab in browser or\n",
    "```julia  \n",
    "using IJulia\n",
    "notebook(dir = pwd())\n",
    "```\n",
    "to open a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Course material is updated frequently. Remember to `git pull` to obtain the most recent material. "
