## Today

* EM algorithm.

* HW5 progress: intercept term, SDP/cone solvers, take $n=100$ in Q3 (exact optimal design), commercial vs open-source solvers for (MI)SDP, D-optimal design in presence of nuisance parameter, projecting approximate design to integer simplex, ...

* HW4 feedback (if time permits).
