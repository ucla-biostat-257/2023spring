## Announcement

* TA office hours posted. Wed 11am-1pm at Biostat Library (CHS 51-254).

## Q&A

* Xiang: memory allocations.

* Sisi: in `@benchmark`, samples vs evaluations. From the `BenchmarkTools.jl` [manual](https://juliaci.github.io/BenchmarkTools.jl/dev/manual/)

> The reasoning behind our definition of "sample" may not be obvious to all readers. If the time to execute a benchmark is smaller than the resolution of your timing method, then a single evaluation of the benchmark will generally not produce a valid sample. In that case, one must approximate a valid sample by recording the total time it takes to record `n` evaluations, and estimating the sample's time per evaluation as `t/n`. For example, if a sample takes 1 second for 1 million evaluations, the approximate time per evaluation for that sample is 1 microsecond. It's not obvious what the right number of evaluations per sample should be for any given benchmark, so BenchmarkTools provides a mechanism (the `tune!` method) to automatically figure it out for you.

## Today

* Computer languages (cont'd).

* Introduction to Julia (1-7, 12-16).

* Julia plots, Jupyter.

* Homework 1 posted. How to get started?
